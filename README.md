# covid-19 Data Analysis using Python
## Project Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 data to understand trends in confermed cases, recoverables, deaths, and vaccinations rates. The analysis helps, identify patterns, growth trends, and key insights using Python and data visualization technique.
## Objectives
- Analyze COVID-19 datasetusing Python
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends using charts and graphs
- Extracts meaningful insights from real-world data
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter notebook
## Dataset
The dataset includes information such as:
- Confermed cases
- Death cases
- Vaccination data
- Country/ Region-wise data
## Step performed
1. Imported and loaded the dataset using Pandas
2. Cleaned and Preprocessed the data
3. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
4. Create Visualization (line charts, bar, charts)
5. Identified trends and patterns
## Key Insights
- Identified growth trends of COVID-19 cases overtime
- compared recovery and death rates
- Visualized country-wise and global trends
- Demonstrates ability to work real-world datasets
## Now to run the project
1. Download the .ipynb file
2. Open it to jypyter notebook
3. Run all cells step-by-step
## Conclusion
This project denonstrates practical skills in Python,data alaysis, and data visualization, and showcases the ability to work with real-world datasets.
